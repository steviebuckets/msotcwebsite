This is the README for my website, www.mysideofthecity.com. Created with the help from a template from Start Bootstrap. I used the Grayscale template and made some tweaks and changes along the way.

# [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/)

[Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) is a multipurpose, one page HTML theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This template features various content sections and a Google Maps section with a custom map marker.



## Creator
